## Features

1. **Pokémon Search**: Users can enter the name of a Pokémon in the search bar to find information about a specific Pokémon.

2. **Pokémon Details**: Upon selecting a Pokémon, the application displays detailed information about the chosen Pokémon, including its types, abilities, height, weight, and stats.

3. **Responsive Design**: The Pokédex is designed to be responsive and accessible on different devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
